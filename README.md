# DHL_Return_Label
A small program which communicate with DHL to get the label for return shipment.

Spent few hours to get the label from DHL service. So thought about sharing it, in case someone else needed it. This solution is based on Spring and uses spring-ws and spring-ws-security module.
It is quite a simple solution, so in case you havn't worked with Spring-ws module before, its a good hands-on practice.
